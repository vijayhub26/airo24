          <p>Cryptic Heist is a word-guessing game with a twist. Your mission is to guess a secret word
            by making guesses that are related in meaning. Each guess gives you hints, bringing you
            closer to the target word. It's a race against time that tests your language skills and strategy.
            Join the heist, crack the code, and prove you're the master of words!
